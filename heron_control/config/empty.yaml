# The empty Heron extras configuration has nothing in it and should not.
# It is meant to override the default to add custom control parameters
# file in your own Heron customization package and setting HERON_CONFIG_EXTRAS
# to your customization file in the launch file control.launch.
# Each parameter will need to be loaded in the correct namespace to
# be used. For example, for a Heron with a modified EKF configuration
# This can be used to change ekf_localization_node/odom0 and odom0_config
# parameters to use a different IMU
