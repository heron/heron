          In case other modules are added to the vehicle (such as a manipulator)
          that also have link running with the underwater object plugin, they
          should also be added in this block. For this, this new module should
          have a file similar to gazebo.xacro above with the description of the
          parameter necessary for the underwater object plugin to be initialized.
